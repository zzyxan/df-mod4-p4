# Exercise 2 
## For this exercise I started off by importing the Ch09 project file into Autopsy, then running a keyword search for "Special Project-A". The book tells you to look for file extensions, then images, since the known bad files are all images, but I felt like using the keyword search was more usefull. Then I tagged all the files as "Special Project-A", then ran a report that exported to excel to get all the hashes for the files. After that I created a new hash set using the Tools > Options > Hash Sets and added the hashes to the database.
